<p style="font-family:courier;">While designing a logo for the Southworth Planetarium I was very inspired by my own childhood. Our middle school used to be partners with a local planetarium, we’d frequently take various trips there for our astronomy portion of science class. It was one of my favorite memories from childhood and it opened my eyes to a different way of learning. It's so beneficial for children, especially young girls to be exposed to different types of fields such as astronomy, in real world scenarios. I took a deep dive through the different shows that the planetarium is currently offering and noticed that almost, if not all, were targeted for a younger audience. Seeing as Southworth reflected my own thoughts, the first idea that came to mind for the design of their logo would include a curious girl. Playing with this idea of youth I thought it would be most effective to create a logo that almost had an obvious meaning. Scrolling through The university’s branding page I recognized a pattern of, “simplicity does more”, in terms of consumer loyalty and recognition. In terms of physical location, I wanted to incorporate the pre-existing branding while adding a personal flare that is relatable to a general audience. Husky pride takes high in the sky!</p>
